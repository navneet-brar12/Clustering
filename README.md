In this project, clustering techniques were applied to analyze and group data based on similarity without prior labeling. Using methods such as K-Means clustering, the dataset was effectively segmented into distinct clusters, helping reveal hidden patterns and groupings.

The analysis included:

Data preprocessing and scaling for optimal clustering performance.

Evaluation of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Visualization of cluster distributions and centroids to interpret the results.

The final clustering results (saved in clustering_results.xls) provide valuable insights into the natural structure of the data, which can assist in further decision-making or serve as a foundation for supervised learning tasks. This assignment demonstrated the power of unsupervised learning in exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition.
